This project was funded by a grant from the Pulitzer Center and provided by Eye on Ohio, the nonprofit, nonpartisan Ohio Center for Journalism. Please join the free mailing list for Eye on Ohio as this helps provide more public service reporting: https://mailchi.mp/f9b9f3b5d058/eyeonohio

This project is the code behind these two articles: 

<b>How do public officials make Land Bank decisions? Artificial Intelligence may seek patterns</b> https://eyeonohio.com/how-do-public-officials-make-land-bank-decisions-artificial-intelligence-may-seek-patterns

<b> [Not yet available] </b> (Link to come, this story is still embargoed.)


For a general explainer, see this article: <b> Sidebar: What is Artificial Intelligence and why use it to look at public records?</b> https://eyeonohio.com/sidebar-what-is-artificial-intelligence-and-why-use-it-to-look-at-public-records/

<b>Caveats:</b> This project is limited in that most properties are just one parcel number, but each address could be made up up multiple parcel numbers. For detailed explanations of each line of code, please see the Land Bank AI and Land Bank 2 .Rmd files above. (It was too much to include in one, and the knit file was huge as well so that's why it's on Github.) 

This website houses the code and most of the files for the project. Files too big for Github can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bU3eQQX6YjnWKtQmr9jRkpwkWwmPIz_4?usp=sharing
